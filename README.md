# Hello-Galaxy-
I am envisioning a App - a very simple application, that does some what like the Hello, World! app 
but instead of introducing a new dev to the language, Hello Galaxy does a few orders of managitude more. 
 I hope there is a small subset of all the programming idioms and phrases that would introduce the 
experienced devs to all new languages.  Much like Hello, World! is designed to quickly introduce you 
to a running program in the target language.  A target Hello, Galaxy? program would help you understand 
the basic usage of many more of the common features of a programming language.
